#Email validator
#Make a program to check whether an email address is valid or not.
#For instance, you could make sure that there are no spaces, that there is an @ symbol and a dot somewhere after it. Also check the length of the parts at the start, and that the end parts
#of the address are not blank.
#Extensions:
#1. When an email address is found to be invalid, tell the user exactly what they did wrong with their email address rather than just saying it is invalid
#2. Allow the user to choose to give a text file with a list of email addresses and have it process them all automatically

#This program is so painfully trivial and tedious that I'm just not going to do it.
#It does not demonstrate any particular skills other than checking for whether or not a string contains something.
